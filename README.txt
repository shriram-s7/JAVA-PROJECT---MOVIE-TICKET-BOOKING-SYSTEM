# 🎟️ BookMyShow Deluxe  
*A Java-based Desktop Movie Ticket Booking System*

---

## 📖 Overview
**BookMyShow Deluxe** is a desktop-based ticket booking application built using **Java Swing** and **SQLite**.  
It provides two interfaces:  
- **User Panel** → for login, movie selection, seat booking, and simulated payments.  
- **Admin Panel** → for managing movies, showtimes, users, and bookings.

This project aims to digitize ticket management for small theatres or institutions without needing a web server.
